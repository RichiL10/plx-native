///   with the AU queue draining and no error on any surface. Forcing the transcode branch turns
///   that into a `/decision` the server answers with something that fits.
/// * **No container REMUX either** — the half that is easy to miss, because a remux *feels* like
///   a concession already. It is not: a remux copies the codecs and deliberately sends **no
///   cap** (`transcode_query` below omits `videoResolution`/`maxVideoBitrate` on that branch,

///   the same bytes at the same rate one layer down, and stalls identically. Denying it leaves
///   the re-encode, which is the only flavor whose whole point is that the server picks the rate.
///
/// **Not a parameter, deliberately — THIS policy sends no number at all.** A cap is meaningless on
/// direct play (no encoder is running to obey it) and on the re-encode branch the server already
/// receives an upper bound it is free to come in far under. The relay's real ceiling is known to

///   numbers (the dev set: 4096x2176; the pre-devcaps constants 3840x2176 remain the fallback).
/// * **`bitDepth=10`** — a CONSTANT, not a derivation: the device table has no bit-depth axis
///   anywhere, so it can neither confirm nor deny 10-bit. The claim stays because it is what
///   keeps HDR10 through a transcode (HEVC Main10, BT.2020+PQ in-bitstream — the same in-band
///   static HDR10 SEI the direct-play path relies on; ff.rs keeps it).
///
/// The target's codec lists are FALLBACK CHAINS, not single choices, and the order encodes the
/// whole free-vs-Plex-Pass story (issue #22, found on a reviewer's server):
///
/// * `videoCodec=hevc,h264` — HEVC encoding sits behind Plex Pass. When this list held only
///   `hevc`, a free server found no usable video target and **dropped the video track**: the
///   transcoder job carried a single audio `-map`, the demuxer correctly said
///   `ff: no video stream`, and every MP4 in the library "failed to play" on every firmware.
///   (`TranscoderHEVCEncoding=1` does not help — the subscription gate sits behind the
///   preference.) With h264 in the list PMS always has a working encode, and — just as
///   important — an H.264 source reaching this path for its *container* alone (mp4 → mkv remux)
///   can now be **direct-streamed** (copied) instead of failing: direct-stream requires the
///   source codec to appear in the target list. A Plex Pass server with "Enable HEVC video
///   Encoding = Always" still picks hevc — verified live; order expresses preference. On a SoC
///   without HEVC the chain is `h264` alone: hevc first would have PMS encode a stream the
///   panel cannot decode — the same wrong-side failure #22 was, pointed the other way.
/// * `audioCodec=ac3,eac3,aac` (the caps subset, ac3-preferred order) — same rule on the audio
///   lane: MDE logged "Cannot direct stream audio stream due to codec aac when profile only
///   allows ac3" and re-encoded audio that the pipeline decodes natively. The list is exactly
///   the caps audio subset, so anything copied is something we both feed and decode; a track
