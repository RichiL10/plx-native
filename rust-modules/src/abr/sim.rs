//! **The closed-loop plant the controller is measured against** — host-only, `#[cfg(test)]`, and
//! deliberately small. Increment I0-B/C of `docs/adaptive-playback-plan.md`.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every host test in `abr.rs` hands the controller a `SegmentSample` somebody wrote by hand, so it
//! grades the controller against a world the test author invented. Nothing checks that the world is
//! reachable: eight existing tests pass 20-60 s reserves against 28-60 Mbit/s sources, where the
//! byte-capped AU queues cannot hold more than about four seconds (`§8.7` of the plan). This module
//! closes the loop — the controller's own decisions choose the next rung, the plant decides what
//! that rung costs, and the buffer is whatever the two of them produce.
//!
//! # The independence rule, which is the whole point
//!
//! **The plant must not call the controller's arithmetic.** If `B_max` here were
//! `abr::b_max_est(...)`, every reachability test would be the implementation agreeing with itself,
//! and the defect this module was built to catch — a formula off by a factor of 1000 — would pass.
//! So [`Plant`] carries queue sizes and feed leads as its own explicit parameters, sourced from
//! `player::engine`'s constants by VALUE with a comment, and computes its ceiling itself. When the
//! controller eventually grows a `B_max_est` of its own (increment I5), the two must agree — and
//! *that disagreement is a test*, not a refactor.
//!
//! # The plant
//!
//! Two lanes feed one playable reserve. `aq_push` blocks the single demux thread on either lane's
//! byte cap (`aq.rs`), the pump throttles the video lane to `MAX_FEED_AHEAD_NS` ahead of the
//! presented position and the audio lane to that plus `AUDIO_SLACK_NS` (`player/engine.rs`), and
//! the controller sees `min(video, audio)` (`BufferSnapshot::buffered_ms`). So
//!
//! ```text
//! B_max(R_video, R_audio) = min( video_lead_ms + video_queue_bits / R_video ,
//!                                audio_lead_ms + audio_queue_bits / R_audio )
//! ```
//!
//! **Dimensions.** `kbps` is kilobits per second, which is bits per millisecond. So `bits / kbps`
//! is **already milliseconds** and there is no `* 1000` anywhere in this file. That factor is
//! exactly the bug the first draft of the plan shipped, and it survived review because the
//! reviewer's expected value came from the same expression.
//!
//! # State equations
//!
//! Per segment of content duration `d` ms at delivered media rate `R` kbps over capacity `C` kbps:
//!
//! ```text
//! bytes      = R_ts · d / 8                    (kbps · ms = bits)
//! fetch_ms   = R_ts · d / C                    (bits / kbps = ms)   ← transfer only
//! acquire_ms = fetch_ms + overhead_ms                               ← request → demux complete
//! wall_ms    = max(acquire_ms, B + d - B_max)                       ← backpressure blocks demux
//! stall_ms   = max(0, wall_ms - B)
//! B'         = min(B_max, max(0, B - wall_ms) + d)
//! ```
//!
//! **`acquire_ms` and `wall_ms` are different quantities and the split is load-bearing.** The
//! controller is told ACQUISITION (`total_fetch_us`), because that is what production stamps; the
//! PLANT advances by WALL, because that is what actually elapsed. Conflating them is the defect
//! this module shipped with — see [`step`].
//!
//! The `max(0, ...)` on the reserve and the `stall_ms` line are the same event seen twice: the
//! buffer cannot go negative, and the wall time it could not cover is a stall. The segment is
//! modelled as arriving atomically at the end of its fetch, which is the one deliberate
//! simplification here — it makes a stall at most one segment pessimistic and never optimistic.
//!
//! Differentially, while nothing is blocked or empty, `dB/dt = C/R - 1`, which
//! [`the identity test`](tests::the_plant_reproduces_the_drain_identity) pins directly.
//!
//! # A transaction is not free
//!
//! On `Decision::Prime` the demux worker runs the candidate transaction **inline on its own loop**:
//! the current stream is not read while it runs. So a prime costs wall time with **no fill**.
//!
//! A rejected transaction costs its control/media wall time and contributes no playable media.
//! Candidate objects remain staged until the verdict, so modelling a rejected object as buffer
//! credit would recreate the cross-encoder ownership bug removed from the runtime. That cost is a
//! [`TransactionModel`] split four ways — up/down x
//! commit/reject, each with its control-plane and media legs — and every leg is `Option`, because
//! none of them is measured yet. [`run`] REFUSES an unmeasured leg rather than substituting a
//! constant: one flat number for all four made `T_down` growing on a collapsing link
//! unrepresentable.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! Virtual time only. No `Instant`, no sleep, no thread. The same trace and the same plant produce
//! the same [`Report`] on every machine, which is what makes a two-parameter-set A/B meaningful.
